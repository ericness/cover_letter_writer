The performance and storage limitations of these systems required special data models such as star schemas. The latest wave of column-based data stores such as AWS Redshift are optimized for analytical work loads and no longer require these compromises to perform. Redshift also has an extensive group of partners which provide solutions to ease the loading, transformation and visualization of the source data.\nThis presentation examined a case study of how Field Nation built a data warehouse and financial dashboards in three months using Redshift. We looked at the tools in the data pipeline from data extraction to delivery. By the end of the presentation attendees had a new understanding of how to turn both in-house and SaaS provider data into a coherent whole for their users.\n            \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show less",

The algorithm is valuable for analyzing data in the fields of marketing, social networks and many others.  The session will also examine the types of data that are valid for clustering.
